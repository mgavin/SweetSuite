## Main Features

- **Instant Queue** allows you to automatically queue up for a match after a game ends (That's right, even before the item drop and EXP gain windows pop up!).
- **Instant Training** allows you to load up Freeplay as soon as a match is done (No more navigating menus!), and works great in tandem with Instant Queue.
- **Instant Exit** instantly exits to the main menu after a match is done. (Perfect when you want to get out of the game quickly but don't know what to do next!)

## All Features

- **Instant Queue** - This option allows you to start searching for the same playlist you last searched for immediately after finishing a game.
- **Instant Training** - Instant Training allows you to go right into free play after a match has ended. No more traversing around menus and confirming things to get to training.
- **Instant Exit** - Don't want to train, but still want out of the match in a speedy-like manner? This option kicks you to the main menu as soon as your game is done.
- **Delay** - If you do not want to do something instantly, you can set a custom delay (in seconds) to wait beforehand!
- **Map Selection** - You can choose from most all the available maps in Rocket League to instantly train on from a drop-down menu!
- **Random Maps** - You can select "Random Map" to get a random map when you load into free play
- **AutoGG Support** - If you use the built-in AutoGG feature, no need to worry, you will get your GG in before joining free play.
- **Casual Switch** - Disable plugins for Casual Game modes!
